# Origin Tale of Arachne

Interactive musical interface that tells the origin tale of Spiders (greek mythology of Arachne) using reed sensors, p5js, arduino, and serial communication.  Project was made for Physical Computation midterm at ITP.

## Resources
* [Reed Sensors](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/reed-switch-hookup-guide/all)
* Arduino nano 33 iot
* [Arachne story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvUHcsZOhJ8)

## Process
* Laser etched a web on a black acrylic top
* Used six reed switches and connected them to breadboard and arduino (one pin to ground, other pin to digital input)
* Got enclosure from container store
* Arduino code
* p5 code
* Serial control
